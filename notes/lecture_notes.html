<h3>Week 41</h3>
<p>In this week we built the first 'list of Pokemon' displaying version of the Pokedex app. The app simply displays text of the first 60 Pokemon. We use Retrofit to 'GET' the pokemon list and convert it to Kotlin objects. The object model was taken from another project to save time. Ultimately we will cut this object model down, but for now we'll just take the thing wholesale.</p>
<h3>Week 43</h3>
<p>Leveraging AsyncImage and NavHost we added pictures to our list and detail page that appears when tapping the relevant Pokemon character. You will notice the version I put online also animates, but I didn't have time for that in class.</p>
